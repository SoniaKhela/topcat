Idea is to have a modern, fast - really useful search to really help people instantly find the datasets we hold.

'study'
- instant, as you type (most important thing: very fast, instant feedback)
- highlighting, so you can see the context / snippet of where your query actually matched 
- stemming / plurals. 'study' matches 'study', 'studies', and 'studied'

'bio' 
- partial matching
	'bio' matches 'biotope', 'biota', 'biology', so you can search within words
'bird'
- title is boosted in importance (compared with abstract)

- frequency, how close a phrase matches, other full-text search things
- can use AND or OR
	saltmarsh coast
	saltmarsh AND coast
