A number of the sandbank habitats are of considerable conservation value, most notably the extensive beds of the eelgrass Zostera marina and tide-swept maerl beds composed of the coralline red alga Phymatolithon calcareum. A comprehensive biotope mapping survey of the sublittoral habitats within the Sound was undertaken in August 2001, by a collaborative research group from the University of St Andrews, Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh University and Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH).

Kirk McClure Morton, Belfast are currently involved in a project investigating the erosion and deposition of mobile sediments around Loch Ryan.  This has involved developing a hydrodynamic model of wave action on the loch, and how wave propagation differs between fast ferries and traditional shaped craft.  The effect of the wake from ferries on sediment transport is also being investigated.

A series of additional areas were examined in the Sound of Rum and to the west of Skye. Reefs formed by the cold-water coral Lophelia pertusa were identified in the surveys to the east of Mingulay where they formed characteristic seabed mounds. These mounds were clearly seen on the multibeam bathymetry and backscatter data records. The backscatter also revealed intriguing 'trails' extending downstream from some of these mounds.  Their composition and cause are currently unknown. This information was summarised in the MINCH Geographic Information System (GIS) project.  While there are some indications that small colonies of L. pertusa are present at each for the study areas, clear evidence for significant reef development was only found at Mingulay.

The sandiest sediments were found in the sandwave field in the north of the northern survey area in depths of less than 90 m.  The transition to coarser sandy sediments with an increased percentage of shell debris, pebbles and gravel followed an abrupt transition away from the sandwave field and this was reflected in both the bathymetry and backscatter data.  The area of coarse sandy sediments covered the majority of the northern survey area at 90 m.  In deeper ground more stable mixed sediments became dominant.  Sparse patches of small boulders were found at several sites.  Using the broader JNCC interpreted definition of Annex 1 reefs (Johnston et al, 2002), it was apparent that areas within the SS.SMx.OMx/SS.SMx.CMx.FluHyd mapped area could be considered Annex 1 reef habitat.

The work contributed to the MESH project (www.searchmesh.net) that received European Regional Development Funding through the INTERREG IIIb Community Initiative (www.nweurope.org). The aims of the survey were to acquire high resolution multibeam, sub-bottom profiler and seabed imagery data in the SW Approaches area, located approximately 320km southwest of Lands End.  The cruise not only mapped the variable morphology of the area, but also investigated the biological communities within the canyon system for the assessment of potential Special Areas of Conservation (SAC) under the EC Habitats and Birds Directive (Annex I) (Johnston et al. 2002).

The approach taken to achieve these objectives was to assess the extent and distribution of serpulid reefs from observations by diver along 110 transects around the loch. Detailed studies were also performed at four of the major serpulid reef sites in the loch. Here, distribution was examined with sidescan sonar, reef density by video and the community of organisms associated with the habitat by diver survey of the reefs themselves and of the surrounding sediment. The distribution and abundance of Modiolus was examined along seven relocatable transects and, at one of the major mussel beds, the size structure of the population and associated community surveyed.

GB100014,,Broadscale remote survey and mapping of sublittoral habitats and their associated biota in the Firth of Lorn: biotopes,"Methodologies for broad scale mapping of sublittoral habitats and biota based on acoustic remote sensing was developed as the Broadscale Mapping Project (BMP), a three year project funded by a consortium consisting of the Crown Estate, the Countryside Council for Wales, English Nature, Scottish Natural Heritage and Newcastle University through the SeaMap Research Group. The project was also supported by the European Commissions Life programme. The Firth of Lorn study area was selected by Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) because it encompassed a wide range of physical environmental conditions and had considerable existing conservation value. Part of the BMP study area was recently put forward as a possible Special Area of Conservation in recognition of the significant marine biological interest of both intertidal and subtidal rocky reefs. A nested survey strategy was developed for the Firth of Lorn which involved careful pre-planning and iterative field survey. By adopting this nested and iterative approach, the overall summary maps comprise a jigsaw of small maps where the underlying data vary in their level of detail. The main features and biota were mapped using  acoustic remote sensing techniques combined with biological sampling. Linking the biological data with the acoustic data was completed using classification techniques developed for processing satellite images.

It is supported by the European Commission under the Life programme. The survey of the Milford Haven, Pembrokeshire and south Cardigan Bay has contributed to the development of a methodology for broad scale survey and mapping of large areas of sea floor using acoustic remote sensing techniques. The methodology relies on the relatively inexpensive acoustic ground discrimination system (AGDS) based on a single beam echo sounder. Image processing requires ground truth samples of the biota and habitats from the sea floor and the sampling techniques range from the traditional grab, trawl and dredge to the deployment of remote video.
