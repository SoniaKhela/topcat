"GB000284","","MNCR Area Summaries - Inlets in the Bristol Channel and approaches","The habitats and communities of the marine inlets of south-west Britain have been the subject of various surveys, primarily the Harbours, Rias and Estuaries (HRE) programme commissioned by the then Nature Conservancy Council. The HRE surveys were carried out by the Field Studies Council Oil Pollution Research Unit (OPRU) between 1985 and 1989 and covered all of the major and most of the minor inlets between Portsmouth and Milford Haven. The report summarises information on fourteen marine inlets, from the River Hayle in Cornwall northwards to Milford Haven in Pembrokeshire. The data from the HRE surveys, together with data from a variety of other sources, have been analysed to classify the marine biotopes present and to describe their distribution within each inlet.","biota","{""jncc-broad-category"", ""SeabedHabitatMaps""}, {""MESH_GUI"", ""GB000284""}, {""reference-manager-code"", ""B236""}, {""SeabedSurveyPurpose"", ""Nature conservation""}, {""SeabedSurveyTechnique"", ""Intertidal survey""}, {""SeabedSurveyTechnique"", ""Diver survey""}, {""OriginalSeabedClassificationSystem"", ""MNCR""}, {""SeabedMapStatus"", ""Show on webGIS""}, {""SeabedMapStatus"", ""Translated to EUNIS""}, {""SeabedMapStatus"", ""Data Provider Agreement not required - owned by JNCC or MESH - FULL ACCESS""}","1985-01-01","1996-12-31","","Moore, J., Smith, J., Northern, K.O., & Little, M.

"GB000945","","Sound of Harris - Biotopes","The Sound of Harris is a topographically complex marine area situated between North Uist and Harris in the Outer Hebrides. Very little is known of the marine biota of the area but it is likely to be largely unmodified by anthropogenic influences. An increased knowledge of the marine biotope distribution in the Sound of Harris is desirable in order to assess the potential impacts of any proposed future developments in the area. Specifically, proposals to build access causeways linking Hebridean Islands are increasingly under consideration. Such developments have the potential to radically modify environmental conditions in neighbouring marine habitats. This study utilised satellite imagery, underwater acoustic sensing techniques and biological ground surveys to develop a biotope distribution map of the area and relate this distribution to prevailing environmental conditions.","biota","{""jncc-broad-category"", ""SeabedHabitatMaps""}, {""MESH_GUI"", ""GB000945""}, {""reference-manager-code"", ""R3541, OF1309""}, {""SeabedSurveyTechnique"", ""Satellite imagery""}, {""SeabedSurveyTechnique"", ""AGDS""}, {""SeabedSurveyTechnique"", ""Diver survey""}, {""SeabedSurveyTechnique"", ""Grabs""}, {""SeabedSurveyTechnique"", ""Drop camera""}, {""SeabedSurveyTechnique"", ""Diver video""}, {""OriginalSeabedClassificationSystem"", ""MNCR""}, {""SeabedMapStatus"", ""Show on webGIS""}, {""SeabedMapStatus"", ""Translated to EUNIS""}","2005-08-09","2005-08-14","2007-06-30","Malthus, T.J., Harries, D.B., Karpouzli, E., Moore, C.G., Lyndon, A.R., Mair, J.M., Foster-Smith, B., Sotheran, I. and Foster-Smith, D.

"GB001091","","Extent of Serpulid reef and Modiolus modiolus beds in Loch Creran","The purpose of the current study was to initiate site condition monitoring of the reefs of Loch Creran. This was done to establish a baseline biological data set that would facilitate the assessment of the condition of the reef habitats in the future and to allow a judgement to be formed on the current condition of these habitats. The approach taken to achieve these objectives was to assess the extent and distribution of serpulid reefs from observations by diver along 110 transects around the loch. Detailed studies were also performed at four of the major serpulid reef sites in the loch. Here, distribution was examined with sidescan sonar, reef density by video and the community of organisms associated with the habitat by diver survey of the reefs themselves and of the surrounding sediment. The distribution and abundance of Modiolus was examined along seven relocatable transects and, at one of the major mussel beds, the size structure of the population and associated community surveyed. Subtidal rocky reefs were surveyed by diver along relocatable transects at three sites.","biota","{""jncc-broad-category"", ""SeabedHabitatMaps""}, {""MESH_GUI"", ""GB001091""}, {""reference-manager-code"", ""R3906""}, {""SeabedSurveyPurpose"", ""Nature conservation""}, {""SeabedSurveyTechnique"", ""Side scan sonar""}, {""SeabedSurveyTechnique"", ""diver survey""}, {""SeabedSurveyTechnique"", ""towed video""}, {""SeabedSurveyTechnique"", ""diver video""}, {""OriginalSeabedClassificationSystem"", ""EUNIS""}, {""SeabedMapStatus"", ""Show on webGIS""}, {""SeabedMapStatus"", ""Confidence assessment required""}, {""SeabedMapStatus"", ""Translated to EUNI","2005-07-11","2005-09-08","2010-11-30","Moore, C.G., Saunders, G.R., Harries, D.B., Mair, J.M., Bates C.R., and Lyndon, A.R.

The loch supports some of the best Scottish and UK examples of bedrock reef habitats and associated communities. The site has been selected as a candidate Special Area of Conservation (cSAC) on the basis of the quality of the reefs present. A biotope mapping survey of the sublittoral habitats within the loch was undertaken in July and August 2001, by a collaborative research group from the University of St Andrews, Heriot-Watt University and Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH). Rapid broad scale remote acoustic mapping techniques were utilised and ground truth data were collected to enable the interpretation of the acoustically-classed seabed maps. These data supplemented the considerable body of existing knowledge on Loch Sunart marine communities and this information was depicted in a series of biotope distribution maps.

This information supplemented the existing knowledge on the distribution of marine communities within the Sound of Barra pSAC and all this information was synthesised into a series of biotope classification maps.","biota","{""jncc-broad-category"", ""SeabedHabitatMaps""}, {""MESH_GUI"", ""GB000360""}, {""reference-manager-code"", ""R3301, OF1309""}, {""SeabedSurveyPurpose"", ""Research""}, {""SeabedSurveyPurpose"", ""Nature conservation""}, {""SeabedSurveyTechnique"", ""Satellite imagery""}, {""SeabedSurveyTechnique"", ""AGDS""}, {""SeabedSurveyTechnique"", ""Diver survey""}, {""SeabedSurveyTechnique"", ""Grabs""}, {""SeabedSurveyTechnique"", ""Cores""}, {""OriginalSeabedClassificationSystem"", ""Local""}, {""SeabedMapStatus"", ""Show on webGIS""}, {""SeabedMapStatus"", ""Tra","2001-08-01","2001-08-31","2003-12-31","Bates, C.

"GB000423","","Broadscale mapping of sublittoral habitats in the Sound of Barra: south west of South Uist","This map covers the area in the north of The Sound of Barra, at the south-western end of South Uist.The Sound of Barra has been selected as a possible Special Area of Conservation (pSAC) on the basis of the nationally important colony of common seals, Phoca vitulina, and also for the wide variety of habitats associated with shallow ‘sandbanks which are slightly covered by seawater all the time’. A number of the sandbank habitats are of considerable conservation value, most notably the extensive beds of the eelgrass Zostera marina and tide-swept maerl beds composed of the coralline red alga Phymatolithon calcareum. A comprehensive biotope mapping survey of the sublittoral habitats within the Sound was undertaken in August 2001, by a collaborative research group from the University of St Andrews, Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh University and Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH). This information supplemented the existing knowledge on the distribution of marine communities within the Sound of Barra pSAC and all this information was synthesised into a series of biotope classification maps.","biota","{""jncc-broad-category"", ""SeabedHabitatMaps""}, {""MESH_GUI"", ""GB000423""}, {""reference-manager-code"", ""R3301""}, {""SeabedSurveyPurpose"", ""Research""}, {""SeabedSurveyPurpose"", ""Nature conservation""}, {""SeabedSurveyTechnique"", ""Satellite imagery""}, {""SeabedSurveyTechnique"", ""AGDS""}, {""SeabedSurveyTechnique"", ""Diver survey""}, {""SeabedSurveyTechnique"", ""Grabs""}, {""SeabedSurveyTechnique"", ""Cores""}, {""OriginalSeabedClassificationSystem"", ""Local""}, {""SeabedMapStatus"", ""Show on webGIS""}, {""SeabedMapStatus"", ""Translated ","2001-08-01","2001-08-31","2003-12-31","Bates, C.

Kirk McClure Morton, Belfast are currently involved in a project investigating the erosion and deposition of mobile sediments around Loch Ryan.  This has involved developing a hydrodynamic model of wave action on the loch, and how wave propagation differs between fast ferries and traditional shaped craft.  The effect of the wake from ferries on sediment transport is also being investigated.

"GB000662","","Mapping Inshore Coral Habitats: the MInCH project","The objective of the Mapping INshore Coral Habitats or MINCH project was to assess the current distribution and status of cold-water coral habitats to the east of the Island of Mingulay. A series of additional areas were examined in the Sound of Rum and to the west of Skye. Reefs formed by the cold-water coral Lophelia pertusa were identified in the surveys to the east of Mingulay where they formed characteristic seabed mounds. These mounds were clearly seen on the multibeam bathymetry and backscatter data records. The backscatter also revealed intriguing 'trails' extending downstream from some of these mounds.  Their composition and cause are currently unknown. This information was summarised in the MINCH Geographic Information System (GIS) project.  While there are some indications that small colonies of L. pertusa are present at each for the study areas, clear evidence for significant reef development was only found at Mingulay. We propose that this area be referred to as the Mingulay Reef Complex.  Further work is now needed to characterise the diversity of the reef-associated community, record the hydrodynamic regime and complete detailed visual surveys of the reef habitat.","biota","{""jncc-broad-category"", ""SeabedHabitatMaps""}, {""MESH_GUI"", ""GB000662""}, {""reference-manager-code"", ""OF732""}, {""SeabedSurveyPurpose"", ""Nature conservation""}, {""SeabedSurveyPurpose"", ""Research""}, {""SeabedSurveyTechnique"", ""Multibeam echo sounder""}, {""SeabedSurveyTechnique"", ""AGDS""}, {""SeabedSurveyTechnique"", ""Towed video""}, {""OriginalSeabedClassificationSystem"", ""Local""}, {""SeabedMapStatus"", ""Show on webGIS""}, {""SeabedMapStatus"", ""Translated to EUNIS""}, {""SeabedMapStatus"", ""Data Provider Agreement signed FULL","2003-06-28","2003-07-05","2004-03-31","Roberts,J.M.; Brown,C.J.; Long,D.; Wilson,C.K.; Bates,C.R.; Mitchell,A.; Service,M.

"GB000946","","Mid-irish Sea Reef Habitat Map","The aim of this research contract was to improve understanding of the habitats and communities present in an area of the Irish Sea identified as potentially containing Annex I reef habitat according to the Habitats Directive.  Survey cruises were undertaken in November 2006 and January 2007 onboard the University Marine Biological Station, Millport (UMBSM) Research Vessel Aora, with specialists from the National Oceanography Centre (NOC), ERT (Scotland) Ltd (ERT), UMBSM and Seatronics Ltd. The sandiest sediments were found in the sandwave field in the north of the northern survey area in depths of less than 90 m.  The transition to coarser sandy sediments with an increased percentage of shell debris, pebbles and gravel followed an abrupt transition away from the sandwave field and this was reflected in both the bathymetry and backscatter data.  The area of coarse sandy sediments covered the majority of the northern survey area at 90 m.  In deeper ground more stable mixed sediments became dominant.  Sparse patches of small boulders were found at several sites.  Using the broader JNCC interpreted definition of Annex 1 reefs (Johnston et al, 2002), it was apparent that areas within the SS.SMx.OMx/SS.SMx.CMx.FluHyd mapped area could be considered Annex 1 reef habitat.

The work contributed to the MESH project (www.searchmesh.net) that received European Regional Development Funding through the INTERREG IIIb Community Initiative (www.nweurope.org). The aims of the survey were to acquire high resolution multibeam, sub-bottom profiler and seabed imagery data in the SW Approaches area, located approximately 320km southwest of Land’s End.  The cruise not only mapped the variable morphology of the area, but also investigated the biological communities within the canyon system for the assessment of potential Special Areas of Conservation (SAC) under the EC Habitats and Birds Directive (Annex I) (Johnston et al. 2002).  The cruise also tested the application of the survey standards and protocols developed under the MESH project.  The cruise was the first thorough test for the recently completed MESH Guidance Framework, providing a ‘proof of concept’ from planning to completion.","biota","{""jncc-broad-category"", ""SeabedHabitatMaps""}, {""MESH_GUI"", ""GB000971""}, {""reference-manager-code"", ""OF1273""}, {""SeabedSurveyPurpose"", ""Nature conservation""}, {""SeabedSurveyTechnique"", ""Multibeam echo sounder""}, {""SeabedSurveyTechnique"", ""Sub bottom profiling""}, {""SeabedSurveyTechnique"", ""Drop camera""}, {""OriginalSeabedClassificationSystem"", ""EUNIS""}, {""SeabedMapStatus"", ""Show on webGIS""}, {""SeabedMapStatus"", ""Confidence assessment complete""}, {""SeabedMapStatus"", ""Not to be translated to EUNIS""}, {""SeabedMap","2007-06-04","2007-06-18","2007-06-30","Stewart, H A, and Davies, J S. 2007.

As a result, the Southeast Strategic Regional Coastal Monitoring Programme has been able to upgrade their single-beam bathymetric surveys to achieve 100% seafloor coverage to IHO Order 1a standard through collaboration with the Maritime and Coastguard Agency’s Civil Hydrography Programme. Although the main purpose is to survey the bathymetry of the seabed, the full coverage bathymetry combined with acoustic backscatter information collected during the swath bathymetry survey can be integrated with ground-truthing information to produce a series of detailed maps.","environment","{""jncc-broad-category"", ""SeabedHabitatMaps""}, {""MESH_GUI"", ""GB001106""}, {""reference-manager-code"", ""to be filed""}, {""SeabedSurveyPurpose"", ""Coastal monitoring""}, {""SeabedSurveyTechnique"", ""Multibeam echosounder""}, {""SeabedSurveyTechnique"", ""Diver survey""}, {""SeabedSurveyTechnique"", ""Cores""}, {""OriginalSeabedClassificationSystem"", ""EUNIS""}, {""SeabedMapStatus"", ""Show on webGIS""}, {""SeabedMapStatus"", ""Confidence assessment required""}, {""SeabedMapStatus"", ""Translated to EUNIS""}","2010-01-01","2010-12-31","2011-07-31","Kinnear, R.

"GB001115","","Haig Fras habitat map - EUNIS and Annex I Reef","The result of a multidisciplinary field survey of the Haig Fras SAC which was initiated in January and completed during March/April 2011. The current study was initiated to investigate the extent of Annex I reef habitat at Haig Fras. Cefas and JNCC collected full-coverage multibeam bathymetric and backscatter data and associated ground-truthing data. This data has been analysed to update the extent of the Annex I reef and produce a broadscale habitat map. Seven biotopes were identified from drop camera transects with the predominant biotope characterised by Devonshire cup corals, sponges and crustose communities on wave-exposed circalittoral rock. The broadscale habitat map indicates the presence of four main biotopes; high energy circalittoral rock, moderate energy circalittoral rock, deep circalittoral coarse sediment and deep circalittoral sand.","biota","{""jncc-broad-category"", ""SeabedHabitatMaps""}, {""MESH_GUI"", ""GB001115""}, {""SeabedSurveyTechnique"", ""Multibeam echo sounder""}, {""SeabedSurveyTechnique"", ""Drop camera""}, {""OriginalSeabedClassificationSystem"", ""EUNIS""}, {""SeabedMapStatus"", ""Show on webGIS""}, {""SeabedMapStatus"", ""Confidence assessment required""}, {""SeabedMapStatus"", ""Translated to EUNIS""}","2011-01-20","2011-03-31","2012-03-01","Curtis, M., Diesing, M. and Stephens, D. 2012.

"GB001117","","Croker carbonate slabs, Mid-Irish Sea","In May 2008 (18-27 May), a survey commissioned by JNCC undertook seabed habitat investigations of two Areas of Search (AoS) for offshore SACs. The objectives of this survey, within the Submarine structures in the mid-Irish Sea AoS and the Solan Bank AoS, were to acquire high quality acoustic data capable of identifying and delineating habitats listed under Annex I of the 1992 EC Habitats Directive; primarily the Annex I habitat Submarine structures made by leaking gases in the former AoS and Annex I Reef habitat in the latter AoS. Surveys consisted of both broad-scale and fine-scale acoustic techniques, utilising sidescan sonar and multibeam swathe bathymetry, along with a variety of ground-truthing techniques including towed and drop down video/stills and Hamon grab sampling. A Rock dredge was also used at a few stations in order to gather samples of epibiota from hard substrata to assist with the taxonomic identification of the video and still images. The range of sampling techniques employed ensured that any Annex I habitats could be adequately described and  characterised. For both AoSs survey planning and interpretation of survey data utilised extensive pre-existing data sets.","biota","{""jncc-broad-category"", ""SeabedHabitatMaps""}, {""MESH_GUI"", ""GB001117""}, {""SeabedSurveyTechnique"", ""Multibeam echo sounder""}, {""SeabedSurveyTechnique"", ""Side scan sonar""}, {""SeabedSurveyTechnique"", ""Towed video""}, {""SeabedSurveyTechnique"", ""Drop camera""}, {""SeabedSurveyTechnique"", ""Grabs""}, {""SeabedSurveyTechnique"", ""Dredges""}, {""OriginalSeabedClassificationSystem"", ""EUNIS""}, {""SeabedMapStatus"", ""Show on webGIS""}, {""SeabedMapStatus"", ""Confidence assessment required""}, {""SeabedMapStatus"", ""Translated to EUNIS","2008-05-18","2008-05-27","2008-05-01","Whomersley, P., Wilson, C., Clements, A., Brown, C., Long, D., Leslie, A., Limpenny, D. 2010.

The Loch Maddy project will assist in the development of best practise for future monitoring and reporting programmes for other marine SACs in the UK and Europe. The first phase (1998-9) concentrates on testing variability within methodologies and the determination of the minimum intensity of sampling necessary to provide adequate data for monitoring. The second phase (1999-2000) will concentrate on repeatability However, the major part of the 1998-9 study,  which concentrates on the use of acoustic ground discrimination systems (AGDS) for biotope mapping, will make use of previous mapping studies undertaken in 1996 and will provide valuable guidance for future studies on repeatability of mapping.

"GB100014","","Broadscale remote survey and mapping of sublittoral habitats and their associated biota in the Firth of Lorn: biotopes","Methodologies for broad scale mapping of sublittoral habitats and biota based on acoustic remote sensing was developed as the Broadscale Mapping Project (BMP), a three year project funded by a consortium consisting of the Crown Estate, the Countryside Council for Wales, English Nature, Scottish Natural Heritage and Newcastle University through the SeaMap Research Group. The project was also supported by the European Commission’s Life programme. The Firth of Lorn study area was selected by Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) because it encompassed a wide range of physical environmental conditions and had considerable existing conservation value. Part of the BMP study area was recently put forward as a possible Special Area of Conservation in recognition of the significant marine biological interest of both intertidal and subtidal rocky reefs. A nested survey strategy was developed for the Firth of Lorn which involved careful pre-planning and iterative field survey. By adopting this nested and iterative approach, the overall summary maps comprise a jigsaw of small maps where the underlying data vary in their level of detail. The main features and biota were mapped using  acoustic remote sensing techniques combined with biological sampling. Linking the biological data with the acoustic data was completed using classification techniques developed for processing satellite images.

It is supported by the European Commission under the Life programme. The survey of the Milford Haven, Pembrokeshire and south Cardigan Bay has contributed to the development of a methodology for broad scale survey and mapping of large areas of sea floor using acoustic remote sensing techniques. The methodology relies on the relatively inexpensive acoustic ground discrimination system (AGDS) based on a single beam echo sounder. Image processing requires ground truth samples of the biota and habitats from the sea floor and the sampling techniques range from the traditional grab, trawl and dredge to the deployment of remote video.

This aims to establish an appropriate programme of surveillance and monitoring for the Special Areas for Conservation (SAC) and to trial monitoring methodologies and protocols for the features of a site. The Loch Maddy project will assist in the development of best practise for future monitoring and reporting programmes for other marine SACs in the UK and Europe. The first phase (1998-9) concentrates on testing variability within methodologies and the determination of the minimum intensity of sampling necessary to provide adequate data for monitoring. The second phase (1999-2000) will concentrate on repeatability However, the major part of the 1998-9 study, which concentrates on the use of acoustic ground discrimination systems (AGDS) for biotope mapping, will make use of previous mapping studies undertaken in 1996 and will provide valuable guidance for future studies on repeatability of mapping.
